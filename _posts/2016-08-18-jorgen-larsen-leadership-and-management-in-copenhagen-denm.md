JØRGEN LARSEN   
Leadership and Management (Copenhagen, Denmark)

## ABOUT

I have been working with software development for the last 27 years as a developer, project manager, manager, marketeer, CTO, COO and CEO. Over this period I have accumulated extensive experience and knowledge of the software development process, methodologies, management, estimation, process improvement, quality assurance and recruitment. My focuses are on delivering quality products and solutions, on time, by using people-oriented leadership and management. I try to combine a high degree of knowledge with simplicity while keeping in mind that we are only humans trying to do magic with technology.

## PROFILE HIGHLIGHTS

■ Innovative, dynamic and open-minded.  
■ A real leader with a solid core-value system.  
■ Inspire confidence and believe in people.  
■ Visionary with strong intuition (gut feeling).  
■ Both general and in-depth knowledge about technology.  
■ Strategist and a rational person with strong analytical and systematic skills.  
■ Driven by a desire to create better solutions in less time than the norm.  
■ INFJ personality (http://j.mp/infjtype)

## MY PROFESSIONAL MANIFESTO

■ I will build high performance organisations with trust, freedom and openness.

■ I will care for people much more than for high profit margins.  
■ I will embrace and respect the values of others.  
■ I will protect the people in my organisation from business bullshit.  
■ I will openly collaborate with partners and customers.  
■ I will act as a servant leader.
